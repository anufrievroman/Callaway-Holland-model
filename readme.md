# Callaway-Holland model
Python implementation of Callaway-Holland model to calculate the thermal conducticity of materials and nanostructures. \
At the moment the code models silicon, but you can use the dispersion relation for your material. You can choose the limiting dimension and surface roughness. The code will output thermal conductivity vs. temperature.
