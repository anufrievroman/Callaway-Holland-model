# Callaway-Holland model
Python implementation Callaway-Holland model to calculate the thermal conducticity of materials. At the moment if simulates silicon, but you can add your own dispersion relation for your material. You can choose the limiting dimension and surface roughness. The code will output thermal conductivity vs. temperature.
